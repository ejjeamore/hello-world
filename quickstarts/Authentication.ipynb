            "* **Clarity and Readability:** Added comments to explain each part of the code. The function now has a docstring to explain its purpose, arguments, and return value.\n",
            "* **Two Sorting Methods:**\n",
            "    * **`sorted()` (Recommended):** The `sorted()` function is the preferred way to sort a list in most situations because it creates a *new* sorted list, leaving the original list unchanged.  This is generally safer and avoids unintended side effects.\n",
            "    * **`list.sort()` (In-place):**  The `list.sort()` method sorts the list *in place*, meaning it modifies the original list directly. This can be useful if you don't need to keep the original list, but you need to be careful because it *mutates* the list.  I've commented it out in the main function to encourage the use of `sorted()`, but included it for completeness.\n",
            "* **Return Value Consistency:** The function consistently returns a sorted list.\n",
            "* **Docstring:** A clear docstring makes the function's purpose and usage immediately understandable.\n",
            "* **Efficiency:** The `sorted()` and `list.sort()` methods are highly optimized for performance. You generally don't need to write your own sorting algorithm unless you have very specific requirements.\n",
